                                <h4>4. THE WALLET</h4>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Description</strong><br> The Wallet is provided to you exclusively by QikPay DSwiss IT services. The Wallet is only capable of supporting certain Virtual Currencies. Under no circumstances should you attempt
                                    to store Virtual Currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support. 5.1.2 When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive
                                    any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency network. YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING YOUR PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS, BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE
                                    KEYS AND NETWORK ADDRESSES. If you do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access Virtual Currency previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we discontinue
                                    or no longer offer some or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to Virtual Currency. We are not responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf. <br>
                                    <strong>Trading Wallet</strong> <br> The Wallet will generally be made available on a non-custodial basis enabling you to self-custody your Virtual Currency. Any Virtual Currency you purchase using fiat currency in
                                    the Wallet will be held in the Trading Wallet. All Virtual Currency held in your Trading Wallet will be custodial assets held on trust by QikPay.co for your benefit on a custodial basison trust for your benefit. Among
                                    other things, this means that: a. Title to the Virtual Currency shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to any company in the QikPay.co Group. As the owner of Virtual Currency in your Trading Wallet,
                                    you shall bear all risk of loss of such Virtual Currency. QikPay.co shall not have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Virtual Currency held in your Trading Wallet. b. None of the Virtual Currencies
                                    in your Trading Wallet are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, QikPay.co; QikPay.co does not represent or treat assets in a user’s Trading Wallet as belonging to QikPay.co. QikPay.co may not grant a security
                                    interest in the Virtual Currency held in your Trading Wallet. Except as required by a facially valid court order, or except as provided herein, QikPay.co will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise
                                    alienate Virtual Currency in your Trading Wallet unless instructed by you or compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so. c. You control the Virtual Currency held in your Trading Wallet. At any time, subject
                                    to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Virtual Currency by sending it to a different QikPay address controlled by you or a third party. In the event you wish to transfer Virtual Currency
                                    into the Wallet, you may be prompted to set up a backup phrase in order to do so. d. In order to more securely custody assets,QikPay.co may use shared QikPAy addresses, controlled by a member of the QikPay.co Group,
                                    to hold Virtual Currencies held on behalf of customers and/or held on behalf of QikPay.co. Your Virtual Currency is segregated from the QikPay.co Group own Virtual Currency by way of separate ledger accounting entries
                                    for customer and QikPay.co Group accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing,A although we maintain separate ledger accounting entries for customer and QikPay.co accounts, no member of the QikPay.co Group shall have any
                                    obligation to segregate by QikPAy address Virtual Currencies owned by you from Virtual Currencies owned by other customers or by any member of the QikPay.co Group. e. We may store any Virtual Currency you deposit for
                                    use on QikPay.co Exchange in a “hot wallet”, “cold wallet” or other storage method in our sole discretion. The Trading Wallet will be exclusively provided by QikPAy Access UK. <br>
                                    <strong>Minimum Holding Periods</strong> <br> When you place purchase orders in the Trading Wallet, we may impose minimum holding periods in respect of any Virtual Currency that you have purchased which may last up
                                    to a maximum of 7 days. These minimum holding periods are necessary to enable us to carry out effective fraud prevention measures and to ensure that the fiat currency leg of any given transaction has settled. After
                                    this minimum holding period elapses, you may trade your Virtual Currency in the ordinary way. <br>
                                    <strong>No Cancellation</strong> <br> You may not cancel, reverse or change any transaction in the Trading Wallet. We may suspend, delay, redirect, reverse or cancel any transaction at any time and for any reason. For
                                    example, and without limitation, we may do so if we suspect any risk of fraud, crime, breach of this User Agreement, or illicit activity. You will bear the costs of any network fees charged in respect of such suspension,
                                    delay, redirection, reversal or cancellation. <br>
                                    <strong>Transaction Limitation</strong> <br> We may implement transaction limits in the Trading Wallet. These may vary based on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the time of your transaction, your
                                    location, the Virtual Currency purchased, and the Virtual Currency sold. We implement, raise and lower transaction limits in the Trading Wallet in our sole discretion. <br>
                                    <strong>Reversals of payment instructions and/or negative balances</strong> <br> If you reverse a payment instruction initiated with your bank, payment services provider or equivalent or part of a transaction fails
                                    for any reason which results in your Trading Wallet having a negative balance, we may liquidate any assets held in any account you hold with us (including the User Accounts) to offset and reduce the negative balance.
                                    You remain fully responsible for settling the balance and we may engage debt collectors to pursue any outstanding debt on our behalf. <br> In order to be completed, any Virtual Currency transaction created with the
                                    Wallet must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network. Such networks are decentralised, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties,
                                    which are not owned, controlled or operated by QikPay.co. <br> QikPay.co has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via our Services
                                    will be confirmed on the relevant Virtual Currency network. The transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network used to process
                                    the transaction. We do not guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in any Virtual Currency or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title. <br> Once transaction details have been submitted to a
                                    Virtual Currency network, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. QikPay.co has no control over any Virtual Currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate
                                    any cancellation or modification requests. <br>

                                    <strong>No Password Retrieval</strong> <br> With respect to the Wallet, QikPay.co does not receive or store your Wallet password, nor any keys, network addresses or transaction history. We cannot assist you with Wallet
                                    password retrieval. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret your Wallet password. Any Virtual Currency you have associated with such Wallet may become inaccessible if you do not know or
                                    keep secret your Wallet password. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can dispose of Virtual Currency in
                                    your Wallet <br> When you create a Wallet, you must: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) protect and keep secret
                                    all credentials for the Wallet; (d) protect access to your device and your Wallet; (e) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use the backup functionality
                                    provided through the Wallet and safeguard your backup files. You agree to take responsibility for all activities that occur with your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorised or unauthorised access to your Wallet,
                                    to the maximum extent permitted by law. <br>
                                    <strong>Fees</strong> <br> QikPay.co does not currently charge a fee for the Wallet receiving, sending or controlling Virtual Currency. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display
                                    to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation “miner’s fees”) required to use a Virtual Currency network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to calculate
                                    such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may select a greater or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any such fee and QikPay.co shall neither
                                    advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.
                                </p>

                                    may include a fee, which you agree to pay. Swap works in connection with the Wallet, by which we shall deliver to you the requested Virtual Currency, less any applicable fees, by executing a transaction from a Virtual
                                    Currency address we control to one associated with your Wallet. <br>
                                    <strong>Due Diligence</strong> <br> We may, at our sole discretion and from time-to-time, require you to satisfy our Compliance Program before participating in Swap or receiving funds. In order to use Swap, you agree
                                    to cooperate with any such request and pay any associated fees, which may be modified or supplemented at any time.

                                    <p>
                                        Your use of the Services requires you to bear risks for which we cannot be held responsible. We list some, but not all of these risks below: a. Hardware, software or connections required to interact with a Virtual Currency network might fail, succumb
                                        to malware, unauthorised access or malicious attacks. Third parties may obtain unauthorised access to the Services, including, but not limited to your public and private keys. QikPay.co shall not be responsible
                                        for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services, however caused. <br> b. Forks, unknown vulnerabilities
                                        in or unanticipated changes to the network protocol may cause losses to you or others. QikPay.co has no control over any cryptocurrency network and shall not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of
                                        the inability to reverse a transaction, and any losses in connection therewith due to erroneous or fraudulent actions. <br> c. The risk of loss of value in using Services involving Virtual Currencies may be substantial
                                        and losses may occur over a short period of time. In addition, price and liquidity are subject to significant fluctuations that may be unpredictable. <br> d. Virtual Currencies are not legal tender and are not backed
                                        by any sovereign government. In addition, the legislative and regulatory landscape around Virtual Currencies is constantly changing and may affect your ability to use, transfer, or exchange Virtual Currencies. <br>                                        e. When placing a “market order” in a Virtual Currency, your order will be executed immediately at the current market price. Market orders do not carry a limit price and will trade with anything on the order book.
                                        During periods of high volume, fast market conditions, illiquidity, or volatility in the marketplace, the actual price that a market order is executed at may be different from the best price indicated at the time
                                        of your order, and in some cases significantly so. <br> f. Under certain market conditions you may find it difficult to liquidate a position. In such circumstances, QikPay.co Exchange may not have sufficient demand
                                        to meet your request to execute such a transaction. Placing contingent orders, such as a “stop” or “limit” order does not guarantee your potential loss will be limited to an intended amount, as market conditions
                                        may make it difficult to execute such orders. You may suffer losses due to orders executing at lower or higher values than anticipated or requested. <br> g. Virtual Currency transactions may not be reversible. Once
                                        you send Virtual Currency to an address, you may lose access to your Virtual Currency temporarily or indefinitely. For example, an address may have been entered incorrectly, or an address may belong to an entity
                                        that will not return your Virtual Currency. Virtual Currency mistakenly sent to an address we control may not be recoverable. By using the Services, you agree that the data sources that maintain your accounts and
                                        any third parties that interact with your Credentials or account data in connection with our service are not liable for any loss, theft, compromise, or misuse whatsoever in connection with our services (including
                                        negligence), except to the extent such liability cannot be limited under applicable law. Data sources make no warranties of any kind related to the data provided by our services--whether express, implied, statutory,
                                        or otherwise. No data provided by us is an official record of any of your accounts.

                                        <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong> <br> BaseSwap.io, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY AMOUNT
                                        GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO US BY YOU OR BY YOU TO US IN CONNECTION WITH A SUPPORTED VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON ITS DISPLAYED TERMS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS,
                                        VALUED IN GREAT BRITISH POUNDS AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION; OR (B) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE,

                                        OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FOR EXAMPLE (AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE), YOU MAY NOT RECOVER FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR OTHER TYPES
